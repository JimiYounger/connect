# Forecasting Tool - Project Plan & Documentation

## üéØ Project Goal
Build a simple, effective weekly forecasting tool for sales teams where:
- **Managers** submit weekly forecasts through a mobile-friendly wizard
- **Executives** view aggregated forecasts across regions/teams
- **Admins** can modify survey questions as needed

## üèó Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - No over-engineering
   - Straightforward user flows
   - Minimal dependencies

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Single source of truth
   - Reusable components
   - Centralized business logic

3. **Single Function Architecture**
   - Each function/component does ONE thing well
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to test and debug

### Technical Principles
- **Mobile-First PWA**: Design for phones, scale up to desktop
- **Standard Components**: Use shadcn/ui defaults, no custom styling overhead
- **Minimal State**: Keep state management simple, use React Query for server state
- **Open Access**: No complex permissions, simple authenticated access
- **Clean Aesthetics**: Black & white with purposeful color (green=good, red=concern, blue=action)

## üìã Implementation Strategy

### Phase Approach
1. **Foundation** - Database & types
2. **Collection** - Survey wizard
3. **Visualization** - Dashboard
4. **Management** - Admin tools

### Technical Stack
- **Database**: Supabase (3 simple tables)
- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router + React
- **UI**: Shadcn components (Card, Button, Input, Progress)
- **State**: TanStack Query + Local storage for drafts
- **Charts**: Recharts (already installed)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

```

## üìä Database Schema

### Tables
1. **forecast_questions**
   - Core question data
   - Section grouping
   - Display order
   - Active status

2. **forecast_responses**
   - User submission metadata
   - Week/team/area/region tracking
   - Submission timestamp

3. **forecast_answers**
   - Individual answer storage
   - Links response to question
   - Flexible text/number storage

### Design Decisions
- Separate answers table = flexible question changes
- Week stored as Monday date = consistent reporting
- JSONB for select options = easy updates
- No hard deletes = historical integrity

### Issue Template
```
#### Issue: [Brief description]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Symptoms**: What went wrong?
**Root Cause**: Why did it happen?
**Solution**: How was it fixed?
**Lessons Learned**: What to remember
---
```

### Resolved Issues

#### Issue: Incorrect Supabase import paths
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Symptoms**: TypeScript errors for missing module '@/lib/supabase/supabase-auth-helpers/client'
**Root Cause**: Using deprecated auth helpers instead of new @supabase/ssr
**Solution**: Updated imports to use '@/lib/supabase' for client and '@/lib/supabase-server' for server
**Lessons Learned**: Always check existing project patterns before adding new dependencies

#### Issue: Type mismatch in useState Map
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Symptoms**: TypeScript error with Map<string, unknown> vs Map<string, string | number>
**Root Cause**: JSON.parse returns unknown types, need explicit casting
**Solution**: Added type assertions when loading from localStorage
**Lessons Learned**: Be explicit with type casting when dealing with serialized data

#### Issue: Missing toast hook
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Symptoms**: Cannot find '@/components/ui/use-toast' module
**Root Cause**: Wrong import path for toast functionality
**Solution**: Changed to '@/hooks/use-toast' and destructured { toast } from useToast()
**Lessons Learned**: Grep existing codebase for correct import patterns

#### Issue: Survey showing "No questions available"
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Symptoms**: API returns empty questions array despite 14 questions in database
**Root Cause**: API route was calling client-side service from server context
**Solution**: Rewrote API route to use server-side Supabase client directly
**Lessons Learned**: Keep server and client code separate - don't call client services from API routes

#### Enhancement: People Multi-Select for Team Questions
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Need**: Questions about specific team members need searchable multi-select for users
**Solution**: Add 'people_multi_select' question type with JSONB storage
**Implementation**:
- Store user IDs as JSON array in answer_text field
- Searchable dropdown filtered by area, expandable to all users
- Update Q4, Q5, Q8, Q9 to use new type

#### Enhancement: Optional Text Area for People Questions
**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Need**: Some people selection questions need additional text input for context/plans
**Solution**: Add 'include_text_area' field to questions, show both people + text when enabled
**Implementation**:
- Add include_text_area boolean to forecast_questions table
- Store as: ["user1","user2"]||Additional text here
- Enable for Q4, Q5, Q9 (need context/plans) but not Q8 (just unavailable list)

#### Issue: Foreign Key Constraint Error on Survey Submission
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Symptoms**: Insert error violates foreign key constraint "forecast_responses_user_id_fkey"
**Root Cause**: Code inserting user.id (Supabase auth) but FK points to user_profiles.id (different UUID)
**Solution**: Use profile.id instead of user.id, add error handling for missing profiles
**Lessons Learned**: Always verify foreign key relationships match actual data flow

#### Issue: Week Dates Showing Sunday Instead of Monday
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Symptoms**: Area selection shows "Week of Sunday, September 21, 2025" instead of Monday
**Root Cause**: Two different Monday calculation functions with inconsistent logic
**Solution**: Fixed getNextMonday() function in survey hook with simple, clear date math
**Lessons Learned**: KISS principle - don't overcomplicate date calculations

#### Enhancement: Area Selection with Region Mapping
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Need**: Managers need flexibility to submit forecasts for different areas
**Solution**: Added area selection screen before survey questions
**Implementation**:
- Shows current area by default with clear week information
- Dropdown to select different area if needed
- Auto-populates region based on area selection
- Sets team=null when submitting for different area

#### Enhancement: Multi-Area Forecast Support
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Need**: Managers should be able to submit multiple forecasts per week for different areas
**Problem**: Database constraint limited one forecast per user per week, regardless of area
**Solution**: Updated system to support area-specific forecasts with proper data isolation
**Implementation**:
- **Database**: Changed unique constraint from (user_id, week_of) to (user_id, week_of, area)
- **API**: Updated conflict resolution to use area-specific upserts (user_id,week_of,area)
- **Frontend**: Enhanced query system to fetch/cache responses per area context
- **People Selection**: Fixed component chain to show users from target area, not manager's area
- **User Experience**: Same area = update existing, different area = create new record

#### Issue: React Duplicate Key Error in Dashboard Week Selector
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Symptoms**: "Encountered two children with the same key, `2025-09-22`" React error
**Root Cause**: Complex multi-loop week generation logic was creating duplicate dates
**Solution**: Replaced with simple offset-based single loop approach
**Implementation**:
- **Before**: Separate loops for future weeks, current week, and past weeks
- **After**: Single loop with offsets from -8 to +4 relative to current forecast week
- **Benefits**: KISS principle, DRY compliance, guaranteed unique keys
- **Lessons Learned**: Simple sequential logic prevents edge case bugs

#### Issue: Dashboard Timezone Date Display Bug
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Symptoms**: Week selector showing "Sep 21, 2025" but data stored for "Sep 22, 2025"
**Root Cause**: `new Date('2025-09-22')` parsed as midnight UTC, shifted to local timezone during formatting
**Solution**: Add explicit time component to prevent timezone drift
**Implementation**:
- **Before**: `new Date('2025-09-22')` ‚Üí displays "Sep 21, 2025"
- **After**: `new Date('2025-09-22T12:00:00')` ‚Üí displays "Sep 22, 2025"
- **Fixed Components**: Week selector labels, Executive Summary dates
- **Lessons Learned**: Always specify time component for date-only strings to avoid timezone issues
